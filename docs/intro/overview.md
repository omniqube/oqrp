The OQRP Engine is a middleware game engine created by OmniQube. Designed to be used in conjunction with GameMaker, it provides additional functionality and a solid base that a default GameMaker project does not provide. The OQRP Engine is useful for speeding up development of projects, especially when sharing a codebase between them.
