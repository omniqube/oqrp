The OQRP Engine is a middleware game engine created by OmniQube. Designed to be used in conjunction with GameMaker, it provides additional functionality and a solid base that a default GameMaker project does not provide. The OQRP Engine is useful for speeding up development of projects, especially when sharing a codebase between them. What does The OQRP Engine provide? The OQRP Engine provides games with useful features including but not limited to: Dynamic collision system Real time lighting system Text display improvements Graphics improvements Input improvements Game cutscene / animatic system The OQRP Engine enriches projects with components such as: Gamepad support Touch control system for mobile devices Social networking support (for sites like GameJolt) An internal UI for replacing system dialogues An Audio management subsystem A customizable Development Console And many more!","title":"Overview"},{"location":"intro/overview/#the-oqrp-engine-an-overview","text":"","title":"The OQRP Engine - An Overview"},{"location":"intro/overview/#what-is-the-oqrp-engine","text":"The OQRP Engine is a middleware game engine created by OmniQube.
